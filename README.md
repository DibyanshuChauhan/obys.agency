# Obys.agency

Welcome to the **Obys.agency** repository! This project is a personal attempt to replicate the UI of the Ukraine-based design agency **Objs.agency** using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and enhanced with Locomotive.js for smooth scrolling and Sherry.js for animations.

## Key Features:
- **Pixel Perfect Replication**: Carefully crafted layout to mimic the design aesthetics of the original Objs.agency.
- **Interactive Elements**: Incorporates various interactive UI components to enhance user engagement.
- **No Framework or Libraries**: Built from scratch using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (except for Locomotive.js and Sherry.js).
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Integrated Locomotive.js to provide a seamless, smooth scrolling experience.
- **Animations**: Enhanced with Sherry.js to add subtle yet impactful animations.

## How to Install and Run Locally:
